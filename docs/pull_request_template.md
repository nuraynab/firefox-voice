**Outreachy applicants:** please try to get all _new_ PRs submitted by Friday,
April 3rd. After that we'll be trying to review all PRs and respond to 
followups. Earlier is better, as the review load is very high.

Before submitting a final PR, please:

- [ ] Run `npm test` on your machine
- [ ] Run `npm run format` to keep code formatted consistently
- [ ] Reference the issue you are fixing in at least one of your commit messages, as `Fixes #X`
